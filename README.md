[**Dysfunctional Warfare**](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/dysfunctional-warfare) is the **BEST** all propose war pack of all time developed by **Dysfunctional Entertainment** and the minds behind [**Hexangle's Tech, Bombs, Guns, And War**](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/hexangles-tech-bombs-guns-war).

## Client Information:

Dysfunctional Warfare is designed from the ground up with multiplayer and performance in mind. We have included all the essentials mods for a great war pack Flan's Mod, Nuclear Tech Mod, ICBM Classic, and Techguns. Even with these great mods an equivalent tech mods are needed Mekanism, Refined Storage, Immersive Engineering, Industrial Forgoing, Advanced Generators, and PneumaticCraft are included to mass produce your *"Peace Keeping Tools"*. Along with these mods there are many more to round out the experience and ensure the death and destruction of any adversary you may have.

## Server Information:
In collaboration with [ScalaCube](https://scalacube.com/p/_hosting_server_minecraft/2647495) Dysfunctional is able to host a public server that is included by default so anyone can join without needing to maintain there own. We have some plans for an over arching community driven story with large in game events for the community to participate in. Keep in mind were a small team of people that are juggling client and server development and management so adding more to our plate might not be a great idea so early into the servers. And for those that want to operate there own server a server pack is also available for download with all versions past 1.0.
